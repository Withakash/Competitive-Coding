## Practical Explanations (1–25)

1. **MINSTACK Implementation**  
   Stack with push, pop, and ability to get the minimum element in O(1) time.

2. **Expression Evaluation Using Stack**  
   Evaluate postfix/prefix expressions using stack operations.

3. **Next Greater Element**  
   Find the next greater element for each array element using stack.

4. **Circular Queue (k)**  
   Implement circular queue with enqueue, dequeue, front, and rear operations.

5. **Infix to Postfix Conversion**  
   Use the Shunting Yard Algorithm with stack & queue to convert expressions.

6. **Product of Three Largest Distinct Elements**  
   Use a priority queue (max-heap) to find the product of the top 3 distinct values.

7. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**  
   Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.

8. **Find Merge Point of Two Linked Lists**  
   Detect the node where two linked lists intersect.

9. **Swap Nodes Pairwise**  
   Swap nodes of a linked list in pairs without swapping values.

10. **Validate a BST (isValidBST)**  
    Check whether a binary tree satisfies all BST properties.

11. **Build a BST**  
    Insert nodes and construct a Binary Search Tree.

12. **Max Depth of Binary Tree**  
    Find the height of a binary tree using recursion.

13. **Tree Traversals**  
    Implement Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals.

14. **Boundary Traversal of Binary Tree**  
    Print the boundary nodes: left boundary, leaves, and right boundary.

15. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**  
    Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree/BST.

16. **Mirror Tree Check**  
    Check if two trees are mirror images of each other.

17. **Basic Hash Function**  
    Implement a simple hash function and test key-value storage.

18. **Hash Table Using Separate Chaining**  
    Create a hash table with insertion, deletion, and search using chaining.

19. **Two Sum Using HashMap**  
    Return indices of numbers that add up to a target value.

20. **Trie — Insert, Search, Delete**  
    Implement trie operations for storing and searching words.

21. **Huffman Coding**  
    Use a min-heap to generate prefix codes for data compression.

22. **Distinct Substrings**  
    Count all distinct substrings using Trie or hashing.

23. **Count Words in Trie**  
    Count how many words are stored inside a Trie structure.

24. **Left View of Binary Tree**  
    Print nodes visible from the left side of a tree.

25. **Level Order Traversal**  
    Implement BFS on a binary tree using a queue.
