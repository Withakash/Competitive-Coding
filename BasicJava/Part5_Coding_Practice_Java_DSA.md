# Part 5 -- Coding Practice (Advanced Java & DSA)

This section focuses on **hands‑on coding practice** using
industry‑relevant problem‑solving patterns. These topics directly appear
in interviews for top companies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. LeetCode Practice

## What You Must Target

-   Pattern‑based problem solving\
-   Optimized solutions\
-   Clean code + edge cases\
-   Strong understanding of data structures

## Core Categories

-   Arrays\
-   Strings\
-   Hashing\
-   Stacks & Queues\
-   Recursion & Backtracking\
-   Trees & Graphs\
-   Dynamic Programming\
-   Sliding Window\
-   Binary Search

## High‑Value Problem List

-   Two Sum\
-   Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\
-   3Sum\
-   Merge Intervals\
-   Search in Rotated Sorted Array\
-   Binary Tree Level Order Traversal\
-   Number of Islands\
-   House Robber (DP)\
-   Climbing Stairs (DP)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Pattern Printing (Logic Building)

## Concepts You Need

-   Nested loops\
-   Space + star management\
-   Increment/decrement logic\
-   Condition‑based pattern flow

## Must‑Know Patterns

-   Pyramid, Reverse Pyramid\
-   Diamond\
-   Hollow Square\
-   Number Triangle\
-   Floyd's Triangle\
-   Butterfly Pattern\
-   Pascal's Triangle

## Why It Matters

-   Strengthens logic foundations\
-   Sharpens indexing skills\
-   Improves reasoning and loop control

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Sliding Window Technique

## Why It's Important

Sliding Window problems appear in nearly every major interview.
Excellent for optimizing O(n²) solutions to O(n).

## Types of Windows

-   Fixed window\
-   Variable window\
-   Dynamic shrink/expand window

## Key Problems

-   Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K\
-   Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\
-   Longest Subarray with K Distinct Elements\
-   Sliding Window Maximum (Deque)

## Common Mistakes

-   Wrong window resize conditions\
-   Missing edge cases\
-   Forgetting to maintain frequency map

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Binary Search Patterns

## Core Concepts

Binary Search is not only for sorted arrays --- it is a strategy for
**searching answers**, known as **Search on Answer**.

## Where It Applies

-   Sorted arrays\
-   Rotated sorted arrays\
-   Peak finding\
-   Allocation problems (binary search on range)

## Must‑Solve Problems

-   Search in Rotated Sorted Array\
-   First & Last Position of Element\
-   Peak Index in Mountain Array\
-   Koko Eating Bananas\
-   Allocate Books / Split Array Largest Sum

## Key Variants

-   Lower bound\
-   Upper bound\
-   Binary search on function

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Core Mindset

DP is structured thinking --- breaking large problems into subproblems.

## Fundamental Approaches

-   Memoization (Top‑Down)\
-   Tabulation (Bottom‑Up)\
-   State transition formulas\
-   Overlapping subproblems\
-   Optimal substructure

## DP Problem Categories

-   Fibonacci (basic)\
-   Knapsack (0/1 & Unbounded)\
-   DP on Arrays\
-   DP on Strings\
-   DP on Grids\
-   DP on Trees

## Must‑Solve Problems

-   Climbing Stairs\
-   House Robber\
-   Coin Change\
-   Longest Increasing Subsequence\
-   Longest Common Subsequence\
-   Edit Distance\
-   Partition Equal Subset Sum

------------------------------------------------------------------------
